At Sky Betting & Gaming we do hackathon challenges _our way_.

## The Challenge

Rather than us challenging you we want you to challenge us.

Create a series of puzzles, each one unlocking the next, the next being more complex than the last. Think Crystal Maze, Fort Boyard & Jungle Run, but for hackers.

Whether it’s a web-based room escape, a terminal program that needs hacking or a text-based adventure game, we want you to test us.

We’ll be judging the submissions on their difficulty, creativity and execution.

## The Prize

The winning hack will receive four Amazon Echo Dots and a team ticket to [Tick Tock Unlock escape rooms][0] in Leeds.
