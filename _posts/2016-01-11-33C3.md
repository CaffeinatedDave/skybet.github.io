Hallo!

![CCH Hamburg](/images/CCH OUTSIDE.jpg)
I was lucky enough to attend the 33rd Chaos Computer Congress (33c3) this year.

Every year has a motto for example, last years motto was "Gated Communities" this year however, "works for me" was the chosen phrase.

A total of 12k people attended this year and talks were given in three different halls, saal 1, saal 2 and saal G (a smaller room).

(saal 1 and saal 2 could hold around three thousand people)

## A few talks that stood out were:

![Deploying TLS 1.3: the great, the good and the bad](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8348-deploying_tls_1_3_the_great_the_good_and_the_bad)

Although TLS 1.3 is still a while off being given the green light by the IEFT it was really interesting to hear the different security conditions and attack that were considered when the new protocol was first designed,


![Boot strapping a more secure laptop](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8314-bootstraping_a_slightly_more_secure_laptop#video&t=49)

Provided a really good understanding of the attack surface around firmware based malware, and how we as a business could perhaps look at or gain an understanding to better protect our users from these attacks.

![In Search of Evidence-Based IT-Security](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8169-in_search_of_evidence-based_it-security)

The talk offered a different approach to IT security instead of trusting a security product i.e anti virus deployed to end points or some sort of security appliance. 

we should take the same approach as medical science that gets peer reviewed and scrutinized in the hope of increase the effectiveness of Security software and appliances.

No matter what time of day or night there was always something going on wither that's a group of friends retro fitting a motor to one of the conference halls chairs and riding it around in the early hours or numerous gatherings about poetry, robotics and drone i lost count of all the difference and unique projects people have laid out across their tables in the assembley halls.

There really was this ecosystem where everyone has an understanding of one another and people were open and friendly.  For example some guy had a Epson receipt printer spitting out tweets from people at the congress he beckoned me over and asked me to give it ago.

I really would highly recommend the Chaos Computer Congress to anyone and i'd love to go back again next year!
